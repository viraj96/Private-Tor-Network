Apr 27 12:53:38.000 [notice] Tor 0.2.7.6 (git-605ae665009853bd) opening new log file.
Apr 27 12:53:38.070 [notice] Tor v0.2.7.6 (git-605ae665009853bd) running on Linux with Libevent 2.0.21-stable, OpenSSL 1.0.2g and Zlib 1.2.8.
Apr 27 12:53:38.070 [notice] Tor can't help you if you use it wrong! Learn how to be safe at https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning
Apr 27 12:53:38.070 [notice] Read configuration file "/etc/tor/torrc".
Apr 27 12:53:38.078 [notice] Your ContactInfo config option is not set. Please consider setting it, so we can contact you if your server is misconfigured or something else goes wrong.
Apr 27 12:53:38.078 [notice] Based on detected system memory, MaxMemInQueues is set to 2896 MB. You can override this by setting MaxMemInQueues by hand.
Apr 27 12:53:38.078 [warn] Tor is running as an exit relay with the default exit policy. If you did not want this behavior, please set the ExitRelay option to 0. If you do want to run an exit Relay, please set the ExitRelay option to 1 to disable this warning, and for forward compatibility.
Apr 27 12:53:38.078 [warn] In a future version of Tor, ExitRelay 0 may become the default when no ExitPolicy is given.
Apr 27 12:53:38.078 [warn] You have used DirAuthority or AlternateDirAuthority to specify alternate directory authorities in your configuration. This is potentially dangerous: it can make you look different from all other Tor users, and hurt your anonymity. Even if you've specified the same authorities as Tor uses by default, the defaults could change in the future. Be sure you know what you're doing.
Apr 27 12:53:38.078 [warn] V3AuthVotingInterval is very low. This may lead to failure to synchronise for a consensus.
Apr 27 12:53:38.078 [warn] TestingTorNetwork is set. This will make your node almost unusable in the public Tor network, and is therefore only advised if you are building a testing Tor network!

Apr 27 12:53:38.000 [warn] Your log may contain sensitive information - you disabled SafeLogging, and you're logging more than "notice". Don't log unless it serves an important reason. Overwrite the log afterwards.

Apr 27 12:53:39.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more descriptors: we have 0/3, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of exit bw = 0% of path bw.)
